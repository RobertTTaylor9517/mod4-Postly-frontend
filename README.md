### SHOPLY

This is a project I did for MOD4 of Flatiron School.

This website is basically a quick markup of Amazon or another E-Commerce site.
You can make an account by hitting the signup button. When you sign up you have to set your wallet amount for the time being. similar to a giftcard.

Once you're signed up it works like a normal e-commerce website.
